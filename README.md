# Zopsmart Mini Project (Hotel Booking)

The Hotel Booking project, developed using the [Go](https://go.dev/) language and the [Gofr](https://gofr.dev/) framework, operates as a comprehensive API for managing hotel room reservations. With a single model featuring fields such as ID, hotel name, customer name, date, price, room number, and customer contact number, the API facilitates essential CRUD operations necessary for efficient hotel booking management. This backend solution offers seamless integration for hotel systems, optimizing the process of adding, retrieving, updating, and deleting booking entries.
